# Koikatsu Automated Subtitles

This small Python program is developed to automate the addition of subtitles to Koikatsu stories.

It is meant to allow the user to experiment with dialogue options quickly, while providing basic subtitling and image processing capabilities. It does **not** cover other use cases, such as adding text freely on the screen, adding creative effects, real-time image interactions, and so on.

The user is recommended to apply other creative tools with this as a final pre-processing step for better results. For a demonstration of features, see the `examples` folder (note the scripts are run from the root of the repository).

## Installation
Recommended Python version is 3.7-3.10.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

## Usage
Concrete examples are demonstrated in the `examples` folder.
