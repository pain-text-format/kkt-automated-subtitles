# Koikatsu Automated Subtitles

> WARNING: UNSTABLE REPOSITORY!!!

This small Python program is developed to provide some automation for the subtitling of Koikatsu stories: a sequence of KK renders that tell a story. 

It is meant to allow the user to experiment with dialogue options quickly, while providing *very* basic subtitling capabilities. It does **not** cover other use cases, such as adding text freely on the screen, adding creative effects, real-time image interactions, and so on.

The user is recommended to apply other creative tools with this as a final pre-processing step for better results. For a demonstration of features, see the `examples` folder (note the scripts are run from the root of the repository).

## Installation
Recommended Python version is 3.7-3.10. Create a virtual/Conda environment and install the requirements listed in `requirements.txt`. `pip` or `pip3` is recommended:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

## Usage
Concrete examples are demonstrated in the `examples` folder.
